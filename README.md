# blockchain_sharedwallet
This is a solidity coded  Sharewallet project

Real-World Use-Case for this Project 
• Allowance for Children per day/week/month to be able to spend a certain amount of funds. 
• Employers give employees an allowance for their travel expenses. 
• Businesses give contractors an allowance to spend a certain budget

Development-Goal 
• Have an on-chain wallet smart contract. 
• This wallet contract can store funds and let users withdraw again. 
• You can also give “allowance” to other, specific user-addresses. 
• Restrict the functions to specific user-roles (owner, user)
• Re-Use existing smart contracts which are already audited to the greatest extent
